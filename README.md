# MultiverseArena
A "small" turnbased team-battler for me and my friends.

## Status
Currently the goal is to make a fully functional CLI editor for the DataSets.
After that I will move to making the game playable in the CLI.
When the CLI is done work will start on a visual frontend, either in Godot or Raylib.
